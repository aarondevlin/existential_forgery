Given e = n is an RSA public modulus, this program solves two questions. The first is: without factoring n, provide a message m together with its RSA signature, theta, such that m ends with 2017 in base 10.  The second is: without factoring n, check that a given exponent, e' is also valid to verify signed messages.
